## About The Project

<p>The perfect project if you're learning how to interact with 3rd-party APIs. This challenge uses the Advice Slip API to generate random quotes of advice.
The challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the Advice Slip API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br>
3. Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Advice Slip API - random quote generator

## What I learned
A really fun project to practice API with JavaScript. The only issue is that sometimes after requesting new quote, it generates the same so the visitor wouldn't notice it and think it didn't work. Probablt there are ways to avoid it but I decided not to spend much on this right now. 

P.S. 

Seems like the issue was cache, not repetitive quotes which is fixed now!
